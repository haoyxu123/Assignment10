# Assignment10
In this assignment, created a package called trimmedmean. The trimmed mean is a statistical measure that calculates a datasetâ€™s average after removing a certain percentage of extreme values from both ends of the distribution.
All functions and test functions are saved in the trimmedmean folder. In the main.go file, it shows how to use the trimmedmean package. 
For using the package I created, import the package name and find the Gopath in the go.mod file then trimmedmean function can be successfully used in your own file. 

# Outputs compare
I randomly set 100 integers and 100 floats with the same seed for both Golang and R, the outputs are slightly different. The difference between these two is from range 1 to 2.
